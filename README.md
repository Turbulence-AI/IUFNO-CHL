# IUFNO-CHL
1. The code is used in the paper: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.9.084604 (or https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03051), which is the application of the implicit U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (IUFNO) in 3D turbulent channel flow. The work is built upon the pioneering works by Li et al. (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2010.08895), Wen et al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.104180), You et al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2022.115296) and Li et al. (https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0158830).
2. The dataset for training and testing, and the trained model (the .pth weight file) can be downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aifluid/coarsened-fdns-data-chl.
3. The shape of the dataset is 21x400x32x33x16x4 for Re=180. 21 is the number of groups with the first 20 groups for training and the last 1 group for testing. 400 represents the number of time steps. 32x33x16 represents the shape of the grids. 4 represents the flow variables u,v,w and p (note: p is not used for the current incompressible flow).
4. In the datasets, the "*mave*" files are the fluctuation part of the flow field and the "*ave*" files are the mean field which is averaged along the homogeneous x and z directions, the t direction, and amoung the 20 groups. Hence, the shape of the "*ave*" files is 1x1x1x33x1x4. Note that the "*ave*" files are only needed in the testing process when the predicted fluctuations are added back to the mean field. The reader is referred to the following paper for details:

6. The txt files contain the velocity statistics for fDNS and the corresponding testing results for IUFNO. There are 5 columns in the txt files: column 1 is the y<sup>+</sup> values, column 2 is $&lt u &gt$<sup>+</sup>, column 3 is u'<sup>+</sup><sub>rms</sub>, column 4 is v'<sup>+</sup><sub>rms</sub> and column 5 is w'<sup>+</sup><sub>rms</sub>.
